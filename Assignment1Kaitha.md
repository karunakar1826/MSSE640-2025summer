 Assignment 1 - Kaitha

 About Me  
Hi! I’m Karunakar Reddy Kaitha, a student in MSSE640 for Summer 2025. This is my first assignment where I’m learning how Git and GitHub work.



 What This Assignment is About  
The goal here was to get comfortable with Git — how it tracks changes, how to use GitHub for remote repos, and how to manage my code efficiently. I also researched the basics behind version control systems.



 What I Learned from Researching Git

- Types of Version Control:  
  There are centralized systems where everything happens on one server, and distributed systems where each developer has a full copy. Git is a distributed system, which means I have the whole project history on my own machine.

- Snapshots, Not Diffs:  
  Instead of storing just the changes between files, Git takes a snapshot of the entire project every time I commit. This makes history easy to track.

- Repositories:  
  My local repo is the copy on my computer. The remote repo, like the one on GitHub, is where I push my changes so others can see them or so I have a backup.

- Commits:  
  Commits are like save points — they record the state of my files along with info like when I did the change and what I changed.

- Working Directory & Staging Area:  
  The working directory is where I make changes to files. The staging area is like a holding zone where I prepare exactly what changes I want to include in my next commit.

- Git Workflow Diagram:

  This image helped me understand the flow of changes from working directory to commit to remote repo.



 How I Set Up My Repo

1. Created a GitHub account and made a repository called `MSSE640-2025summer`.

2. Set up a local repository on my machine, connected it to GitHub, and configured my Git username and email locally (so it’s specific to this repo).

3. Added a README.md file where I put my research notes, then committed and pushed the changes to GitHub.



 What I Did for This Assignment

- Learned how to initialize a repo and connect it with a remote GitHub repo.

- Practiced adding files to the staging area, committing changes, and pushing those changes remotely.

- Edited the README.md file with my notes and successfully pushed it.



 What I Took Away From This

- Git is a powerful tool for tracking project history and collaborating with others.

- Understanding the staging area is key before committing changes.

- Knowing the difference between local and remote repos helps me manage backups and teamwork.

- Basic commands like `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `git clone` are essential for daily work.
